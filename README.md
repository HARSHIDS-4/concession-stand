# 🎟️ Concession Stand Program

Hi there!   
This is a simple Python project I built to practice basic programming concepts like functions, dictionaries, user input, and formatting output in a fun way.

The idea is to simulate a digital **concession stand** — like the kind you’d see at a movie theater or a school event. It shows a menu, lets you choose items and quantities, calculates your total bill, and prints a neat receipt with the current date and time.

## 🧾 What It Does

- Shows a menu of snacks and drinks with prices
- Lets users choose items and enter how many they want
- Calculates the total cost
- Prints a formatted receipt
- Displays the date and time of purchase

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Standard libraries only (`datetime`)

## ▶️ How to Run It

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repo:
   git clone https://github.com/HARSHIDS-4/concession-stand.git
   
3.Navigate into the folder:
  cd folder_name.
  
4.Run the program:
  python: concession_stand_program.py.
  
You’ll be greeted with a welcome message and the menu. From there, just type in your order and let the program do the rest!

🙋‍♀️ Why I Made This
I built this as one of my first Python mini-projects to get more confident with core concepts. If you're just starting out, feel free to fork this repo, play around with it, and make it your own!

Happy coding!
