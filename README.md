# 🎟️ Concession Stand Program

Hi there!   
This is a simple Python project I built to practice basic programming concepts like functions, dictionaries, user input, and formatting output in a fun way.

The idea is to simulate a digital **concession stand** — like the kind you’d see at a movie theater or a school event. It shows a menu, lets you choose items and quantities, calculates your total bill, and prints a neat receipt with the current date and time.

## ▶️ How to Run It

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repo:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PYTHON_PROJECT.git .
3.Navigate into the folder:
  cd PYTHON_PROJECT .
4.Run the program:

You’ll be greeted with a welcome message and the menu. From there, just type in your order and let the program do the rest!
